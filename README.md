# SIADS643-week 2 assignment - Temperature Line Graph
This project displays a line graph showing the monthly maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees C of Toronto, Canada. <br>
There are a total of five required files. TorontoWeather2022.csv is the csv file containg the weather data to be used. <br>
requirements.txt is the file with the libraries and versions to be installed. main.py is the main script used for running this project. <br>
load_data.py is used for loading in the csv file into a dataframe and performing the processing steps. <br>
Lastly, display_graph.py uses the cleaned dataframe and returns a visualization. <br>

# First, install necessary libraries and versions by running the following command in a terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# To run the script and generate the line graph, have all required files in the same folder and run this command in a terminal:
python main.py TorontoWeather2022.csv
